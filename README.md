# Project Overview
This project is a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The landing page presents my ability to fully combine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project.

A starter code that has a static, non-interactive version of the project was provided by Udacity:
